This project implements a simple cache memory system with a cache controller. The cache stores data in blocks and tracks their validity. The cache controller manages cache hits and misses by comparing tags and indexing the cache memory. When a cache miss occurs, new data is written to the cache, and when a cache hit occurs, the data is read from the cache. This design demonstrates a direct-mapped cache system with a simple read-write protocol.
